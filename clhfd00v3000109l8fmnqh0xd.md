Well, it is one of the most loved courses by Web Developers all around the world due to its **simplicity, creativity, structured and "To-the-point"** explanations

**This course is for Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library.**

if you are new to JavaScript, I would recommend you learn the basics from Youtube, FreeCodeCamp and TheModernJavascript

We learn by application - encountering many new situations while talking about the hows, the whys and the whats that we use to solve them.
